Skin Cancer detection with various techniques

All models (AlexNet, ResNet-Fusion, Vision Transformer) were trained in Colab Notebooks using the A100 GPU.

For convenience and to avoid any installation issues, we recommend running the code through Google Colab.

Model evaluation results can be found in the notebook: Evaluation_HAM.ipynb.
