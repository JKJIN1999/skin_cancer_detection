# Skin Cancer Detection with Various Techniques

This project demonstrates skin cancer detection using multiple machine learning models, including **AlexNet**, **ResNet-Fusion**, and the **Vision Transformer (ViT)**. Each model was trained using the **HAM10000** dataset, leveraging the power of **Google Colab's A100 GPU** for optimal performance.

## Models & Techniques
The following models were implemented, each explained in detail within their respective `.ipynb` files:
- **AlexNet**
- **ResNet-Fusion**
- **Vision Transformer (ViT)**

Each notebook includes step-by-step explanations of the techniques used, as well as the model architecture and training process.

## Model Evaluation
Model evaluation results can be found in the notebook: **`Evaluation_HAM.ipynb`**.

The evaluation notebook contains:
- Model performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, etc.)
- Confusion matrices for detailed performance analysis
- Comparative results between the models

## Running the Code
For convenience and to avoid installation issues, we recommend running the notebooks via **Google Colab**. This ensures access to powerful GPUs (such as the **A100**) and makes setup simpler.

To run the notebooks:
1. Open the desired `.ipynb` file in **Google Colab**.
2. Ensure that the runtime is set to **GPU** for faster training and inference.
3. Follow the step-by-step instructions in each notebook to reproduce the results.

## Dataset
We used the **HAM10000** dataset, which contains labeled images of different skin lesions. The dataset is available for download from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/kmader/skin-cancer-mnist-ham10000).

## Conclusion
This repository provides an in-depth exploration of different models and techniques for skin cancer detection. Each technique is carefully explained in the corresponding notebook, making it easy to understand and replicate the results.

Feel free to explore the notebooks, experiment with different models, and adjust hyperparameters to suit your needs!
